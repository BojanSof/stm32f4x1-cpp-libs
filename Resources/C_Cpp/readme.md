# C/C++ Resources

## Build process

1. [The C build process](https://blog.feabhas.com/2012/06/the-c-build-process/)
  - Describes the process of converting source files in an executable
  - Compilation stage
  - Linking stage

2. (Optional) [Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) 101](https://www.intezer.com/blog/research/executable-linkable-format-101-part1-sections-segments/)
  - Structure of ELF
  - Why would ELF be useful in MCU applications?

## Makefiles

1. [A Simple Makefile Tutorial](https://www.cs.colby.edu/maxwell/courses/tutorials/maketutor/)
  - Just a small introduction, to gain some insight.
  - We are going to use CMake, which can generate these Makefiles for us.

## C++ Resources

1. C++ Primer
  - Good introductory book for C++.
  - Many of the first chapters can be skimmed, as there is similarity with C, although there are differences. So quick reading.
  - Introduction to the C++ STL.
  - Contains advanced topics too.

2. [Modern C++ Tutorial: C++11/14/17/20 On the Fly](https://changkun.de/modern-cpp/pdf/modern-cpp-tutorial-en-us.pdf)
  - Good introduction to modern C++.
  - Requires basic c++ knowledge and understanding.

3. [C++ language](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language)
  - The oficial reference for the C++ language.
  - References for every STL containers, functions, etc.
  - Can be hard to read.
  - Also contains C language reference.

## Online tools

1. [Compiler explorer](https://godbolt.org/)
  - Very nice tool for quick code explorations.
  - Easy to use.
  - Supports multiple compilers, including arm compiler.
  - Gives assembly code view, useful when optimizing code.
  - Supports big number of libraries, making it very easy to try library without the need to setup local project to test it.

## Software development related resources

1. (Optional)[Design patterns in C++](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/cpp)
  - Very good overview, with examples for a great number of design patterns.
  - Esential to accelerate the development process.
